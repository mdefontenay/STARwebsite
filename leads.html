I love STAR because it gave me the opportunity to gain engineering experience while also forming lifelong memories and friendships. Outside of rocketry, I enjoy listening to music, eating, and maintaining an active lifestyle by working out, running, and playing sports!

The things that I'm looking forward to most this year are for all of the launches and tests that we have planned for this year. To me, one of the best parts of the team is the people that we have on it and how helpful they are. Outside of STAR, I love to travel and listen to music.

I've been in STAR for three years on our Recovery team, and over those years I've worked on our IREC 2021, Stage Separation, Minimum Diameter, and Stage Separation 2/IREC 2024 projects. I hope to work in the aerospace industry as a systems engineering once I graduate. In my free time I enjoy playing music and going on adventures to places like national parks. I also love learning and talking about history and random interesting facts and current events.

                        I'm a third-year mechanical engineer and am really interested in design and space exploration! I joined STAR to bring these two passions together and as a project manager for the 23-24 year I hope to create memorable experiences for all members involved. I am also in charge of the scholarship fund which provides scholarships to high school girls pursuing a career in STEM in the bay area. As a first-generation Latina in STEM, providing these kinds of opportunities to other girls is something I am very passionate about, and am excited to be a part of it.

                        After working as Propulsion Lead this past year, I've stepped up to manage the ALULA project, our liquid-powered competition rocket. Through STAR and my academic/professional work, I've developed a knowledge base in technical design/analysis of thermofluid and chemical energy systems as well as in team management. Outside of my technical passions, I love backpacking/hiking, climbing, mountain biking, and pallin' around with the homies.

I look forward to working with the team and having a successful year! Outside of STAR I spend my time teaching music and hanging out with friends.
