Outside of STAR, I'm the captain of Maya, an Indian dance group on campus. I enjoy reading, swimming, and hanging out with the homies. Feel free to reach out!

Last year I was an airframe member and worked on our competition rocket for the 2023 Spaceport America Cup. I love STAR because it gave me the opportunity to gain engineering experience while also forming lifelong memories and friendships. Outside of rocketry, I enjoy listening to music, eating, and maintaining an active lifestyle by working out, running, and playing sports!

In the past, I was a member of the propulsion sub-team, getting to see the successful hot fires of both ELLIE and LE2! The things that I'm looking forward to most this year are for all of the launches and tests that we have planned for this year. To me, one of the best parts of the team is the people that we have on it and how helpful they are. Outside of STAR, I love to travel and listen to music.

I've been in STAR for three years on our Recovery team, and over those years I've worked on our IREC 2021, Stage Separation, Minimum Diameter, and Stage Separation 2/IREC 2024 projects. I hope to work in the aerospace industry as a systems engineering once I graduate. In my free time I enjoy playing music and going on adventures to places like national parks. I also love learning and talking about history and random interesting facts and current events.

This year, I'm excited to work on developing and diversifying our Avionics team! Outside of STAR, I like books, making strange earrings, and talking about my cat.

                        I'm a Senior studying Mechanical Engineering hailing from the Sunny San Diego. I like to think of myself as an overachiever with unlimited gas in the tank. I'm very family-centric and love being a genuine person. I'm very excited to lead recovery this year, a very important part of rocketry, my biggest hobby and interest aside from cars. Let's watch those rockets launch and more importantly, return in tip-top condition!!

                        I'm a third-year mechanical engineer and am really interested in design and space exploration! I joined STAR to bring these two passions together and as a project manager for the 23-24 year I hope to create memorable experiences for all members involved. I am also in charge of the scholarship fund which provides scholarships to high school girls pursuing a career in STEM in the bay area. As a first-generation Latina in STEM, providing these kinds of opportunities to other girls is something I am very passionate about, and am excited to be a part of it.

                        After working as Propulsion Lead this past year, I've stepped up to manage the ALULA project, our liquid-powered competition rocket. Through STAR and my academic/professional work, I've developed a knowledge base in technical design/analysis of thermofluid and chemical energy systems as well as in team management. Outside of my technical passions, I love backpacking/hiking, climbing, mountain biking, and pallin' around with the homies.
