                        Hi everyone, and welcome to STAR! I have had the privilege of leading this amazing team of engineers for more than a year now, and I wouldn't call any other place home. Outside of STAR, I'm the captain of Maya, an Indian dance group on campus. I enjoy reading, swimming, and hanging out with the homies. Feel free to reach out!

Last year I was an airframe member and worked on our competition rocket for the 2023 Spaceport America Cup. I love STAR because it gave me the opportunity to gain engineering experience while also forming lifelong memories and friendships. Outside of rocketry, I enjoy listening to music, eating, and maintaining an active lifestyle by working out, running, and playing sports!

In the past, I was a member of the propulsion sub-team, getting to see the successful hot fires of both ELLIE and LE2! The things that I'm looking forward to most this year are for all of the launches and tests that we have planned for this year. To me, one of the best parts of the team is the people that we have on it and how helpful they are. Outside of STAR, I love to travel and listen to music.

I've been in STAR for three years on our Recovery team, and over those years I've worked on our IREC 2021, Stage Separation, Minimum Diameter, and Stage Separation 2/IREC 2024 projects. I hope to work in the aerospace industry as a systems engineering once I graduate. In my free time I enjoy playing music and going on adventures to places like national parks. I also love learning and talking about history and random interesting facts and current events.

STAR has been an incredible journey, offering me the opportunity to explore a wide range of engineering disciplines, connect with amazing people, and create lifelong memories. I love rockets, gym, and juice. Give me juice.

This year, I'm excited to work on developing and diversifying our Avionics team! Outside of STAR, I like books, making strange earrings, and talking about my cat.
